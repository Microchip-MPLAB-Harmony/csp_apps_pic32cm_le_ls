# NVMCTRL read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the NVMCTRL to erase and program the internal Flash memory.

## Description

This example uses the NVMCTRL peripheral library to erase a row and write an array of values to the internal Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

### Setting up [PIC32CM LE00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit]()

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. The LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the flash memory matched with the written value
    - LED is turned OFF when the value read from the flash memory did not match with the written value
3. The following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| [PIC32CM LE00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit]() | LED0 |

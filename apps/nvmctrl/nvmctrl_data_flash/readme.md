# NVMCTRL data flash

This example application demonstrates code execution from the main Flash memory while performing erase operation in data flash section.

## Description

The main Flash memory can not be read while it is being erased or written, the CPU is stalled during the entire operation. Some devices has the Flash region called data flash that supports read while write feature. The user could execute code from main Flash while the data flash region is being erased or written. This application demonstrates code execution from main Flash while the data flash section is being erased. A software counter is incremented while performing erase operation in data flash section and the counter value is reported in the console.

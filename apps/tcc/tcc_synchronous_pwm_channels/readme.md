# TCC PWM generation

This example application shows how to use the TCC to generate a 2 or 3 phase PWM signals for motor control with dead time.

## Description

TCC module is configured to generate synchronous 2 or 3 phase PWM signals with dead time. The duty cycle of the PWM signals is updated in the period interrupt handler.

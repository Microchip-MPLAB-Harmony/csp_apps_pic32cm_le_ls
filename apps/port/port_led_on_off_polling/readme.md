# PORT polling

This example application demonstrate how to poll the switch input, and indicate the switch status using the LED.

## Description

This application uses the PORT Peripheral library to read the GPIO pin connected to the switch, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate the switch status. LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch is released.
